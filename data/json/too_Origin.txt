The color may turn yellowish, orange, or brownish when the fruitbodies are old or bruised. The underside forms spines of various shapes and lengths (often flattened) and also ridges, sometimes even appearing poroid or gill-like. The cap surface is smooth to wrinkled: under a hand lens the surface is tomentose. The lateral stem tapers to a black base. There is a vanilla to disagreeable odor and mild taste. It fruits on needles, leaves, and other litter in the summer and fall. Microscopic characters include narrowly elliptic spores, 6-8-spored basidia, and a monomitic hyphal system.^ RANGE The accompanying photograph is from a WA collection. S. confluens is reported from AB, NS, QC, AZ, MI, MT, NC, NH, NY, VT, WI, (Ginns(5)), examined from ON, MI, NC, NH, TN, VA, and reported from AL, (Coker(1)), and found in the British Isles (Buczacki) and Finland and Sweden (Eriksson(7)).\n", "CHEMICAL REACTIONS": " \n", "CAP": " fruitbodies are generally pileate [with a cap] \"but may sometimes be resupinate on underside of leaves etc.\", mostly 1-2cm wide, more or less flabellate [fan-shaped] \"and often radially incised\"; caps as a rule concrescent [growing together as a unit] with several stems; white or pale cream but when old or when bruised \"turning yellow or brownish\"; upperside of fruitbody \"smooth or irregularly-concentrically wavy or wrinkled, under the lens appressed tomentose\"^, (Eriksson), 1-2cm high and 1-2cm wide, often \"often formed like half a morning glory, i.e. fan-shaped with margin reflexed or lobed\", margin \"lobed, thin, sterile\"; cap \"white, becoming creamy or buffy when rubbed\"; cap surface \"at first finely tomentose with rather loosely set, slender hairs\", soon practically bald \"but inherently fibrous, irregularly ridged and pitted or nearly smooth, very slightly viscid\", (Coker), 1-2cm across, cap surface villous, tomentose, white, cream, then yellowish or pale orange when old or bruised, (McNeil)\n", "FLESH": " fruitbody soft (young specimens brittle when dried, older ones more tough)^, (Eriksson), flesh about 0.1cm thick, \"white, soft, tender and moderately but distinctly fibrous\".
