There are probably several species in this group (as defined by its morphological characters in the descriptions below), and it seems likely that the species name or names will eventually change for the Pacific Northwest. Wu, G.(1) is a molecular study indicating that Xerocomus tomentosus and a few other species constitute a clade closely related to Phylloporus. RANGE Xerocomus subtomentosus group is found from eastern Canada south to NC, west to CA, north to AK, (Bessette). There are collections from OR and ID at the University of Washington. It occurs in WA (Michelle Seidl, pers. comm.), and is reported from BC (in Redhead), and NS (Grund). This species is said to occur in Europe, Asia, N. Africa, and N. America, (Breitenbach).\n", "CHEMICAL REACTIONS": " ^cap cuticle darkening slightly with KOH, negative to darkening slightly with NH4OH, flesh negative to pale yellow with KOH, flesh negative or pale gray with FeSO4, (Thiers), cap cuticle instantly reddish brown in NH4OH, (Bessette)\n", "CAP": " 6-15cm, convex expanding, sometimes shallowly depressed when mature; when young yellow brown to olive brown to occasionally yellow, usually becoming darker brown when old, no reddish pigmentation on margin or in cracks, margin sometimes staining dark brown when handled; dry, dull, velvety to subtomentose [somewhat tomentose] to matted tomentose, usually not conspicuously areolate [cracked like dried mud] but sometimes cracked at least on margin^, (Thiers), cap 5-18cm, often distinctly areolate [cracked like dried mud] when old; margin with a narrow band of sterile tissue at least when young, (Bessette), 5-15(20)cm, \"yellow brown to drab olive-brown to dull brown, or occasionally yellowish, but in age or especially in wet weather often redder (cinnamon-brown); sometimes with pallid, yellow or reddish-tinged cracks, especially near margin\", minutely velvety but may appear smooth when old, (Arora), dull olivaceous to yellowish-olive or yellow-brown, (Both)\n", "FLESH": " 1-2.5cm thick, firm; whitish to pale yellow, often colored like cap near cap surface, typically turning blue when exposed^, (Thiers), whitish, unchanging or turning slightly blue when cut, (Bessette), pallid to pale yellow, sometimes turning blue slightly when exposed, (Arora), pallid, white-yellowish, unchanging when cut, (Both)\n", "PORES": " 1-2mm, angular to irregular, often compound; changing to blue when bruised, bright yellow to buff, changing to deeper yellow when old, rarely reddish; tube layer 1-2cm thick, becoming shallowly to deeply depressed when old, bright yellow to buff, changing to deeper yellow when old, turning blue when bruised^, (Thiers), 1-2 per mm, angular, gill-like near stem; yellow, becoming dull yellow when old, staining slightly and slowly greenish, then brownish when bruised; tube layer 1-2.5cm thick, (Bessette), 1-3mm, dull yellow to bright yellow, turning blue weakly or not at all when bruised, (Arora), yellow, bruising slightly greenish then brownish, (Both)\n", "STEM": "", "": " 5-11cm x 1-2.5cm at top, equal or narrowing at base; yellow at the top, becoming rust colored in the midportion and pallid at base, occasionally with a yellow background color, but heavily overlain with darker granulations; dry, bald to granulose to appressed fibrillose or longitudinally ridged, sometimes obscurely reticulate at top; \"often with whitish to yellow mycelium and yellow rhizoids arising from the base\"^, (Thiers), 4-10 x 1-3cm, nearly equal or narrowing slightly downward, solid; yellow with reddish brown streaks and stains, staining brownish to reddish brown when handled or when old; dry, scurfy, \"sometimes with raised, rib-like, longitudinal lines\" that may form a partial reticulum at the top; partial veil and annulus absent, (Bessette), 4-14cm x 1-2(3)cm, equal or narrowing either way, firm; yellow to buff, or often stained brown to dull cinnamon especially in lower part, but never red; smooth or scurfy, the top \"often coarsely reticulate from downward-extending tube walls\", (Arora), yellow; pruinose, ribbed near top, (Both), \"may sometimes appear reticulate.
