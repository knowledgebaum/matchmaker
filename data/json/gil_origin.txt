Xerula pudens has a bitter taste, a more reddish brown cap, and colored pileocystidia (Mitchel(1) for the synonym Oudemansiella longipes of Europe). Caulorhiza umbonata (Peck) Lennox has a very elongated rooting base and is well known from California under redwood. Caulorhiza hygrophoroides is a spring fruiting rooting species with a brick-red cap and is associated with oak. Distribution is scattered sparsely across North America - this species or something similar was found in eastern Washington (D. Parker, pers. comm.)\n", "SOURCES": "  Mitchel(1) (as Oudemansiella longipes var. americana), Kuo(5) (accessed March 22, 2014)\n"}
