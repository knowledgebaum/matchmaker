It is abundant among false truffles in the Pacific Northwest (Trappe(13)). RANGE Zelleromyces scissilis is found from southwestern OR to northern CA (Trappe(13)). The distribution is WA, OR, and northern CA west of the Cascade Mountains, (Trappe, M.(3)). The type collection is from CA, (Zeller(11)).
