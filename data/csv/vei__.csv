LATIN NAME(S)  Cantharellus cascadensis  Dunham, O'Dell & R. Molina^  Mycol. Res. 107(10): 1171. 2003
ENGLISH NAME(S)  hybrid chanterelle
NOTES  {See also Orange Chanterelles Table.} Also listed in Gilled Category. Features include a stocky stature, a yellow to orange-yellow cap (often partly whitish) that is wavy with a ruffled margin; decurrent vein-like ridges on the whitish to slightly pinkish spore-bearing surface, whitish flesh that turns yellow to ocher-tan when cut, a whitish stem, and yellowish white spore deposit.^ This species was described in 2003 from Oregon using molecular methods to differentiate it from other chanterelle species. It is the most common chanterelle in the southern Cascades and while typical of higher elevation forest it is found on the coast too, at least in California, (Siegel). It is similar to Cantharellus formosus but differs in cap color, tending toward an intensely bright pure yellow cap, as opposed to orange-yellow or brownish yellow for C. formosus, but occasional C. formosus are found with the bright color. The veined underside is paler than in C. formosus. Spore size  microscopy is not helpful, and the two may grow in the same habitat. The stem of C. cascadensis is only occasionally equal and more often club-shaped or wider in the middle or bulbous, whereas the stem of C. formosus is usually equal or narrowing downward and proportionally longer in relation to cap width than in C. cascadensis. A possible character is that cracking of the cap flanked by orange-brown discoloration during dry weather in C. cascadensis was not observed in C. formosus (Dunham). The English name ""hybrid chanterelle"" is derived from the bright cap color like C. formosus combined with the pale underside like C. albidus (Siegel(2)). RANGE Cantharellus cascadensis is found in OR (Dunham(1)), and had been sequenced for WA also (M. Beug, pers. comm.). There are collections from BC at the University of British Columbia. It also occurs in CA (Siegel(2)). A photo from Montana is said to resemble this species (M. Beug and D. Winkler, pers. comm.)
CHEMICAL REACTIONS  
CAP  4-12cm, flat-convex to slightly umbonate, becoming depressed to deeply depressed when old, margin ""incurved at first (never inrolled), soon becoming uplifted with undulating or crisped margins""; most caps are vivid orange yellow to vivid yellow or light orange yellow (colors from Kelly), central disc occasionally fading to white or very pale yellow when water soaked, with fading progressing toward margin, giving the appearance of concentric circles of increasing color intensity toward margin; often showing dark brownish orange discoloration along cracks with exposure to sun or very dry conditions; ""dry and finely tomentose, when developing in dry conditions, toward margin tomentum forming radial fibrils on some specimens"", surface bumpy or with occasional warts of spore-bearing tissue^, (Dunham), (4)7-15cm across, ""convex and lobed with an inrolled margin when young, expanding to broadly convex or flattened and uplifted with a depressed center""; bright, clear yellow to egg-yolk yellow, ""often mottled with watery yellow or creamy patches"", may be extensively creamy yellow if buried; ""usually quite wavy with a thin, ruffled margin"", cap surface ""moist, smooth to slightly matted-scaly at the center in age"", (Siegel)

NAME ORIGIN  means ""from the Cascade Mountains, Oregon""
SIMILAR  Cantharellus formosus ""has a yellow-orange cap and yellowish to pinkish buff gills, and is usually smaller"" with a distinctly tall, slender stem that has a tapered base, (Siegel), C. formosus shows orange-yellow to brownish yellow hues on cap, whereas C. cascadensis tends toward an intensely bright pure yellow cap (while occasional C. formosus were bright yellow, C. cascadensis were not found to be yellowish brown): the exact relations to colors of Kelly, of Munsell, and of Ridgway are given in Dunham(1). C. formosus averages slightly smaller (6.1cm, range 2.5-15cm) than C. cascadensis (8.6cm, range 4-12cm); another observation in C. cascadensis, of cracking of the cap flanked by orange-brown discoloration during dry weather was not observed in C. formosus. The stem of C. formosus is sometimes equal but more often narrows downward, whereas the stem of C. cascadensis is only occasionally equal and more often club-shaped to wider in middle or bulbous. (Dunham). Particularly old or waterlogged fruitbodies of C. cascadensis may show yellow only on the outermost edge and resemble Cantharellus subalbidus, (Dunham). C. subalbidus ""can be very similar, but usually has a creamy white to ivory cap (but stains yellowish)"", and an equal or tapered stem, (Siegel), Cantharellus roseocanus favors Sitka spruce or pine. It has a bright orange-yellow underside, and when young and wet has pinkish tones on the cap margin. The color differentiation from C. cascadensis is similar to that from C. formosus q.v.

SIMILAR  Cantharellus formosus is similar to Cantharellus roseocanus but 1) tends to be smaller and less yellow [in some areas it tends to be larger, D. Winkler, pers. comm.], 2) lacks the pinkish hoary coating on margin (present on fresh C. roseocanus), 3) has a pinkish tone to the undersurface of the cap that is typically paler than cap (on C. roseocanus typically undersurface is the most intensely yellow tissue of fruiting body), 4) stains yellow readily (C. roseocanus merely exhibits darkened areas where damaged), 5) has spores that rarely exceed 9 microns and length/width ratio 1.47-1.6, as opposed to those of C. roseocanus that often exceed 10 microns, and have length/width ratio 1.72-1.74, (Redhead). C. roseocanus 6) lacks closely appressed scales even when young, whereas C. formosus frequently has small closely adhering, slightly darker scales particularly visible in dry weather, 7) spore deposit darker in color, 8) exhibits no immediate yellow staining, whereas C. formosus when bruised stains yellow at first (slowly), eventually darkening to dull ocher, (Pilz). Cantharellus cibarius of Europe is also similar but C. formosus has stronger orange pigmentation, smaller stature, strongly convex cap at first, and strong orange bruising reaction, (Tylutki). Turbinellus floccosus has scaly usually depressed cap. Chroogomphus tomentosus has cap that is rounder in outline from above, orange flesh, true gills, and blackish spores. Hygrophoropsis aurantiaca has thinner more crowded true gills (may be blunt when young) that are usually more orange than in C. formosus, flimsier flesh, and cap that is not as wavy or frilled, and is often browner cap, (Arora).

NOTES  {See also Orange Chanterelles Table.} Also listed in Gilled category. This species of chanterelle is distinguished from others in the Pacific Northwest when fresh by its marginal pinkish hoary coating and bright yellow spore-bearing surface. The description here is derived from Redhead(24) unless otherwise specified. RANGE C. roseocanus is found in BC, WA, (Redhead), and OR, and likely occurs also in California, (Pilz).

ENGLISH NAME(S)  flat-topped coral, flat-top coral, truncate club coral
NOTES  Clavariadelphus spp. are treated more fully under the Clubs category. Many of them can have vein-like patterns. This species is also included in the Clubs category. Features of Clavariadelphus truncatus include a club-shaped fruiting body that is pinkish cinnamon to lavender-brown when mature with apex yellow-orange, orange or reddish, the blunt apex becoming truncate, excavated, or perforated (umbonate in var. umbonatus), cherry red to fire-engine red reaction of surface to KOH, dark green tissue reaction to FeCl3, and microscopic characters.^ C. truncatus has been regarded by some authors as a mature form of C. pistillaris (of eastern North America, Europe, and Asia) in which the top of the fruitbody has become truncate, but the two differ in the following: 1) C. pistillaris is pale ochraceous to brownish, while C. truncatus has the colors given above, 2) C. pistillaris tastes bitter whereas C. truncatus tastes sweet, 3) the apex of C. pistillaris is spore-bearing, but the apex of C. truncatus is sterile, 4) C. pistillaris is not stained on the surface by KOH and C. truncatus stains cherry red to fire-engine red on the surface, 5) C. pistillaris has spores 10.5-14 x 6-7.5 microns, whereas C. truncatus has smaller spores 9.5-13 x 5.5-7 microns, 6) C. pistillaris occurs in hardwood forests in association with beech, while C. truncatus occurs in coniferous forest. In the umbonate variety, C. truncatus var. umbonatus (Peck), the apex instead of being ""initially broadly obtuse, becoming truncate, excavate or perforate at maturity"" as in var. truncatus, is ""clavate-umbonate to truncate-umbonate at maturity, not becoming excavate or perforate"". In another variety, C. truncatus var. lovejoy (Wells & Kempton) Corner, the apex of the fruitbody is bright red, and spores measure 9.5-12.5 x 4.5-6.5 microns.

ENGLISH NAME(S)  trumpet chanterelle, funnel chanterelle, winter chanterelle, winter craterelle, yellowlegs, yellow-foot
NOTES  Also listed in Gilled category. Craterellus tubaeformis is recognized by the yellow-brown chanterelle-like fruiting body, hollow yellow-brown stem, and the underside of the cap which has radiating vein-like folds and is colored yellowish to grayish brown or violet gray.^ The name Craterellus neotubaeformis nom. prov. is used for this species by Pilz(1) because it is not considered to be the same species as the European taxon. Features of C. neotubaeformis include modest size, dark brown to dingy yellow-brown cap, yellowish to gray or purple-tinged gills, slender hollow yellow to yellow-orange stem, and white spores. Some molecular evidence (Dahlman(1)) indicates that the Pacific Northwest species may not be the same as the one found in Europe and eastern North America. Cantharellus infundibuliformis (see SIMILAR) is usually considered a synonym and this synonymy is maintained by Dahlman(1). RANGE C. tubaeformis is common. It has been found at least in WA, OR (Smith's description is from OR), ID, CA, (Castellano), and AK (Pilz). There are collections from BC at the University of British Columbia.

NAME ORIGIN  means 'trumpet-shaped'
SIMILAR  Several species may have similarly colored cap and decurrent gills (Hygrophoropsis aurantiaca, Chrysomphalina chrysophylla, some Hygrocybe species) but they are thin true gills rather than ridges, (Pilz). Cantharellus infundibuliformis was said to have darker cap, duller stem, cream to yellowish spore deposit, but is regarded as a synonym.

Features of C. neotubaeformis include modest size, dark brown to dingy yellow-brown cap, yellowish to gray or purple-tinged gills, slender hollow yellow to yellow-orange stem, and white spores. Some molecular evidence (Dahlman(1)) indicates that the Pacific Northwest species may not be the same as the one found in Europe and eastern North America. Cantharellus infundibuliformis (see SIMILAR) is usually considered a synonym and this synonymy is maintained by Dahlman(1). RANGE C. tubaeformis is common. It has been found at least in WA, OR (Smith's description is from OR), ID, CA, (Castellano), and AK (Pilz). There are collections from BC at the University of British Columbia.

SIMILAR  Other Hypomyces species are found in the Crust category. Of these, Hypomyces luteovirens, H. lateritius, H. ochraceus, and H. rosellus also grow on Russula or Lactarius species, and at least the first two may cause the spore-bearing surface of the agaric to appear vein-like. Hypomyces macrosporus Seaver (found in WA, AL, CT, MD, NY, OH, SC, WV, Mexico) is distinguishable from Hypomyces lactifluorum only by color (subiculum white to buff, perithecia buff to yellowish amber) and negative reaction to KOH and may be merely an albino form of this species: orange specimens of H. lactifluorum have been found mixed with specimens that were variously white, white with orange streaks and orange-red with white streaks, but only the reddish streaks of the whitish form became purple in KOH, (Rogerson).

ENGLISH NAME(S)  
NOTES  Also listed in Gilled category. This is one of three Polyozellus species occurring in the Pacific Northwest to which the name Polyozellus multiplex has been misapplied. It forms compact clusters of overlapping fan-shaped to spatula-shaped caps that are purplish blue, gray blue or deep blue on the outer (inner) surface (turning violaceous black when old) and arise from a common base in the ground. The outer (lower) surface of the caps forms a network of longitudinal folds that are light to moderate grayish purplish blue. Spores are nearly round to broadly elliptic, nodulose, and colorless, averaging less than 7 microns long.^ It is ""generally not common, but can be abundant locally."" ""It can be used as a source of natural dyes for fibres such as wool and silk, yielding violet, greens, and blues in a high-pH solution"" (Voitk(5)). The description is derived from Voitk(5).

It is also documented from the Kuril Islands in eastern Asia.
CHEMICAL REACTIONS  
CAP  10-20cm or more across and 6-15cm or more high (group of caps), individual caps 3-10cm x 2-8cm x 0.1-0.5cm, fan-shaped, spatula-shaped, sometimes funnel-shaped, narrowing into the stem, cap margin incurved when young, wavy or lobed when old; dark purplish blue to deep or grayish blue, with moderate to light purplish blue zones, soon violaceous black, then black when old, cap margin pale purplish blue to whitish; cap surface ""distinctly to indistinctly concentrically zoned with alternate bands of tomentum that disappear with age, surface then matte to glabrous, somewhat roughened, and faintly zonate, often radially ridged"", margin ""pubescent at first, later matte""
FLESH  soft, brittle; ""dark purplish blue, dark blackish green to olivaceous with KOH""; azonate
UNDERSIDE  outer spore bearing surface with ""sinuous folds or ridges, frequently forking and anastomosing, and at times forming a reticulate or almost poroid surface, sometimes nearly smooth over large areas"" or, more often, smooth near the cap margin; light to moderate grayish purplish blue

ODOR  ""nondistinctive or faintly pungent""
TASTE  mild
EDIBILITY  edible but opinions vary as to desirability (Voitk)
HABITAT  ""on soil and conifer duff, often among mosses"", under Picea (spruce) most commonly, and Abies (true fir); mainly August through October, ""depending in part on latitude and elevation, with earlier fruiting in the north and at higher elevations""
SPORE DEPOSIT  white
MICROSCOPIC  spores (including nodules) 4.8-7.7 x 3.9-6.7 microns, average 6.1 x 5.3 microns, nearly round to broadly elliptic, with multiple nodules 0.5-1.0 microns high and a prominent apiculus, spore inamyloid, colorless, content homogeneous; basidia 4-spored, 30-70 x 5-10 microns, clavate; cystidia 3-7 microns wide, filiform (thread-like), ""straight to irregularly sinuous"", irregularly cylindric, ""tips even or subclavate, not extending beyond basidia""; clamp connections ""in all tissues, but not at all septa""
NAME ORIGIN  ""atrolazulinus"" means ""dark blue"" in Latin, referring to the typical color of the young fruitbody (Voitk)
SIMILAR  Polyozellus purpureoniger has larger fruitbodies, an upper cap surface that is purple when young and brown when mature, an involute cap margin, lighter flesh, and larger spores (averaging over 7 microns long, whereas those of P. atrolazulinus average under 7 microns long), (Voitk(5)). Polyozellus marymargaretae has larger spores (averaging over 7 microns long), and the color is light blue when young ""(with olive-buff streaks and hints of lavender in the cap)"" - it lacks both purple and violet colors, (Voitk(5)). Polyozellus multiplex is not known from western North America - it has a purplish black cap surface (blue to dark blue in P. atrolazulinus) and less tendency for the cap to be zonate, but less colorful or older darkened collections of can be difficult to distinguish, (Voitk(5)).

LATIN NAME(S)  Thelephora palmata  Scop. ex Fr.^  Syst. Myc. 1: 432. 1821
ENGLISH NAME(S)  fetid false coral, stinking earthfan
NOTES  Thelephora spp. are treated more fully under the Corals category. Many of them can have vein-like patterns. This species is also included in the Corals category. Features of Thelephora palmata include 1) multiple branching from a common base, 2) more or less erect, flattened, tough branches that are purplish brown to chocolate brown or darker, the tips whitish when actively growing, 3) short stem, 4) garlic to unpleasant-fetid odor, 5) growth under trees and along paths, and 6) elliptic-angular spiny spores. ^ RANGE Distribution includes WA, PE, PQ, CA, CO, CT, DC, DE, IA, IL, MO, NC, NH, NJ, NY, OH, and PA, (Ginns), OR (Zeller), and BC (in Redhead). There are collections from BC at the University of British Columbia. It is widespread and fairly common in North America, Europe, and Asia, (Trudell).
