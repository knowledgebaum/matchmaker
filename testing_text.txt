FAMILY  Meruliaceae, Order Polyporales, Class Agaricomycetes, Phylum Basidiomycota _**first__first___
LATIN NAME(S)  Abortiporus biennis  (Bull.) Singer^  Mycologia 36:68. 1944;  Daedalea biennis  (Bull.) Fr.
ENGLISH NAME(S)  blushing rosette
NOTES  Features include 1) a fruitbody that is variable in shape and size, and is bracket-like, or top-shaped or rosette-like with a central or lateral stem, 2) a cap that is whitish to pale brown, 3) flesh with an upper spongy layer and a lower firm layer, 4) light buff pores that are angular to maze-like, 5) a tendency of the fruitbody to turn red-brown when handled or injured, 6) a tendency of the fruitbody to incorporate pieces of plants, and microscopic characters.^ Abortiporus biennis is unusual in producing chlamydospores on various parts of the fruitbody (for instance the cap and the stem). A distorted form occurs with no apparent orientation of tubes and may appear poroid over the entire surface. RANGE Abortiporus biennis has been found in BC, WA, OR, ON, PQ, AL, AZ, CA, DE, FL, GA, IA, IL, IN, KY, LA, MA, MD, ME, MI, MO, MS, NC, NE, NJ, NY, PA, OH, TN, TX, and WI, (Gilbertson).

SPORE DEPOSIT  yellowish^ (Breitenbach), white (Buczacki)
MICROSCOPIC  spores 4-6.5 x 3.5-5 microns, broadly elliptic to ovoid, smooth, inamyloid, colorless^; basidia 4-spored, 14-17 x 7-7.5 microns, clavate, with basal clamp connection; chlamydospores present in flesh, 5-8.5 microns, nearly round, smooth, colorless; gloeocystidia infrequent to abundant, up to 75 microns long and 7.5-8.5 microns in diameter, highly refractive in Melzer's reagent, negative in sulfobenzaldehyde, irregular in shape, broadly clavate to cylindric with swellings and constrictions, not incrusted; hyphal system monomitic, generative hyphae with clamp connections, hyphae of upper spongy layer 3-5.5 microns wide, colorless in KOH, "thin-walled, rarely branched", hyphae of lower corky layer "more variable, some thick-walled, with rare clamps, rarely branched", 2.5-4 microns wide, "some thick-walled often branched, with frequent clamps", 2-3 microns wide, "others thin-walled, much branched, with abundant clamps", 2.5-5 microns wide, "tramal hyphae similar to those of lower context", (Gilbertson), spores 4.5-6 x 3.5-4.5 microns, elliptic, smooth, inamyloid, colorless, thin-walled, with droplets; chlamydospores 3-5 x 3-4.5 microns, nearly round, thick-walled, with droplets; gloeocystidia 30-100 x 6-10 microns, cylindric-sinuous to clavate, containing droplets, (Breitenbach)
NAME ORIGIN  means "lasting for 2 years"^ (Gilbertson)
SIMILAR  It differs from similar stemmed polypores in its abundant gloeocystidia and chlamydospores, (Gilbertson). "The presence of both gloeocystidia and chlamydospores distinguishes A. biennis from similar polypores." (Ginns(28) with Latin name italicized)

FAMILY  Albatrellaceae, Order Russulales, Class Agaricomycetes, Phylum Basidiomycota
LATIN NAME(S)  Albatrellopsis confluens  (Alb. & Schwein.) Teixeira^  Boletim do Instituto de Botanica, Sao Paulo 8: 21. 1993;  Albatrellus confluens  (Alb. & Schwein.) Kotl. & Pouzar  Ceska Mykol. 11: 154. 1957;  Polyporus confluens  Alb. & Schwein.
ENGLISH NAME(S)
NOTES  Features include pale apricot to pinkish yellow or pinkish buff fruiting bodies, single to several on branching stem, growing on ground, with weakly amyloid spores and clamp connections^. The description is derived from Gilbertson(1) except where noted. Ginns(1) says that "Although 10 collections of Albatrellus flettii were seen from Washington, no confirmed specimens of Albatrellus confluens are known from the state, although it is reported by Gilbertson and Ryvarden (1986). Perhaps in western North America, Albatrellus flettii is more common than Albatrellus confluens, or perhaps in this area there is only one species, which differs from Albatrellus confluens elsewhere in having the pileus when young with blue tints, and when old, either lacking the blue or mottled with blue. The rare morphological differences in basidiomes indicate that these are sister species and may be subspecies.". One implication is that at least some reports of A. confluens in western North America may have been based on faded fruitbodies of A. flettii. Audet(1) supported the use of the name Albatrellopsis confluens (Alb. & Schwein.) Teixeira, Boletim do Instituto de Botanica, Sao Paulo 8: 21 (1993). The online Species Fungorum, accessed February 3, 2019, maintained the Albatrellus confluens name as current, despite accepting the Albatrellopsis name for the similar (and according to Audet(1) closely related) Albatrellus flettii. RANGE The distribution includes BC, WA, OR, ID, also PQ, AL, AZ, CA, CO, KY, MA, ME, MT, NC, NJ, NM, NY, SC, TN, UT, VT, WV, circumglobal, (Gilbertson), Europe, Asia, (Breitenbach)

NAME ORIGIN  means "running together, blended into one, confluent"^, (Gilbertson)
SIMILAR  Albatrellopsis flettii has prominent blue tints at least when young, but when mature can be colored as A. confluens, (Ginns(28), see also under NOTES); Albatrellus ovinus is white to gray-brown, stains yellow, and has inamyloid spores and lacks clamp connections; Albatrellus avellaneus is pale orange to tan with dark fine scales, has inamyloid spores, and lacks clamp connections
